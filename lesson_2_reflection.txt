Testing for any changes
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. 1) When we initialize a repository a new hidden folder gets created at the current folder location. This new hiddedn folder is used to keep track of the versiona nd its changes.
2) We need to create a repository as repository is a folder for the related files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. In staging area the new files are added and yet not committed and so they can be taken back from the repository.
