When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used to create a new copy of an existing repository within your github account.
Clone is used to create a new repository offline from the github or from an offline existing repository.
Branches is just used to create a new branch
